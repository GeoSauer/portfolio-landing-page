# portfolio-landing-page

Here lies the kickoff project of my 2024 fellowship with Headstarter AI! 
Since I already had a portfolio site I decided to take a crack at using a template and modifying it as little as possible to keep things light and minimalistic. 
This was a great chance to get back to the basics and refresh on the fundamentals of web design and I had a blast doing it.
A fun challenge to overcome was linking this deployed repo to my existing portfolio page and learning about/implementing absolute URLs.
